# Modern Program Design

This project attempts to demistify a modern way of program design.

- *Elements of Programming* by Paul McJones & Alexander Stepanov (June 2009, ISBN-13: 978-0-321-63537-2), applies the deductive method to programming by affiliating programs with the abstract mathematical theories that enable them to work.
- *C++ Software Design Patterns (Early Release* by Klaus Iglberger (August 2021), shows and discusses implementation details [using modern C++ features], but (hopefully) does not get lost in them and always remains focused on the big picture, on software design and design patterns.
- *Grokking Simplicity* by Eric Normand (June 2021, ISBN: 978-1-617-29620-8): How could we define functional programming to include both Clojure and Haskell? That question led to the seed of this book.
- *Functional Programming in C++* by Ivan Cukic (January 2019, ISBN 9781617293818), is meant to teach you an alternative way of using a language (C++): a way that’s different enough that it’ll often feel like you’re using a new language.
