# Modern Program Design

This project attempts to demistify a modern way of program design.

- *Elements of Programming* by Paul McJones & Alexander Stepanov (June 2009, ISBN-13: 978-0-321-63537-2), applies the deductive method to programming by affiliating programs with the abstract mathematical theories that enable them to work.
- *Grokking Simplicity* by Eric Normand (June 2021, ISBN: 978-1-617-29620-8): How could we define functional programming to include both Clojure and Haskell? That question led to the seed of this book.
