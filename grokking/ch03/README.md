# Distinguishing Actions, Calculations, and Data

*Actions*: Depend on how many times or when it is run

- Also called: functions with side-effects, side-effecting functions, impure functions
- Examples: Send an email, read from a database

*Calculations*: Computations from input to output

- Also called: pure functions, mathematical functions
- Examples: Find the maximum number, check if an email address is valid

*Data*: Facts about events

- Examples: The email address a user gave us, the dollar amount read from a bank’s API

> Calculations are *referentially transparent* because a call to a calculation can be replaced by its result. For instance, `+` is a calculation. `2 + 3` always results in `5`, so you could replace the code `2 + 3` with `5` and have an equivalent program. That means you can call `2 + 3` zero, one, or more times and get the same result.

## Actions, calculations, and data apply to any situation

| ACD | Grocery Shopping  | Note
|-----|-------------------|------
| A   | Check fridge      | It matters when I look in the fridge. Tommorow, there may be less milk.
| A   | Drive to store    | Driving twice will use twice as much gas.
| A   | Buy what you need | When I buy broccoli, no one else can after me, so when I buy matters.
| A   | Drive home        | I can't drive home when I'm already at home, so it matters when.

We can’t accept that everything is an action.

- Check fridge: Checking the fridge is an *action* because when we check matters. The information about what food we have is *data*. We will call it a *current inventory*.
- Driving to store: It’s definitely an *action*. However, there are some pieces of *data* in there; for instance, the location of the store and directions to get there.
- Buying stuff is definitely an action, but you could break this down further.
  - *data*: Current inventory
  - *data*: Desired inventory
  - *calculation*: Inventory *minus* (`-`)
  - *data*: Shopping list = desired inventory `-` current inventory
  - *action*: Buy from list

Calculations are often decisions, such as this one, which decides what to buy. Separating actions from calculations is like separating deciding what to buy from buying it.

| Actions        | Calculations      | Data
|----------------|-------------------|---
| Check fridge   |                   | Current inventory
| Drive to store |                   |
|                |                   | Desired inventory
|                | Inventory *minus* | Shopping list
| Buy from list  |  |
| Drive home     |  |

- We can apply the ACD perspective to any situation
- Actions can hide actions, calculations, and data
- Calculations can be composed of smaller calculations and data
- Data can only be composed of more data

Calculations often happen *in our heads*.

- We can ask ourselves, "Do we need to make any decisions? Is there anything we can plan ahead?" *Decisions* and *planning* make good candidates for calculations.

## Applying functional thinking to existing code

1: We start with the original line that we know is an action. We know that the function `sendPayout()` is an action because transferring money to an account does depend on when it is done or how many times it is done.

```
|   |   |   | function figurePayout(aff) {
|   |   |   |   var owed = aff.sales * aff.commision;
|   |   |   |   if (owed > 100)
|   |   | A |     sendPayout(aff.bank_code, owed)
|   |   |   | }
|   |   |   | function affiliatePayout(affs) {
|   |   |   |   for (var a = 0; a < affs.length; a++)
|   |   |   |     figurePayout(affs[a]);
|   |   |   | }
|   |   |   | function main(affs) {
|   |   |   |   affiliatePayout(affs);
|   |   |   | }
```

2: An action, by definition, depends on when it is run or how many times it is run. But that means that the function `figurePayout()` that is calling `sendPayout()` also depends on when it is run. So it, too, is an action.

```
|   | A |   | function figurePayout(aff) {
|   | A |   |   var owed = aff.sales * aff.commision;
|   | A |   |   if (owed > 100)
|   | A | A |     sendPayout(aff.bank_code, owed)
|   | A |   | }
|   |   |   | function affiliatePayout(affs) {
|   |   |   |   for (var a = 0; a < affs.length; a++)
|   | A |   |     figurePayout(affs[a]);
|   |   |   | }
|   |   |   | function main(affs) {
|   |   |   |   affiliatePayout(affs);
|   |   |   | }
```

3: By the same logic, we now have to highlight the entire function definition of `affiliatePayout()` and any place where it is called.

```
| A | A |   | function figurePayout(aff) {
| A | A |   |   var owed = aff.sales * aff.commision;
| A | A |   |   if (owed > 100)
| A | A | A |     sendPayout(aff.bank_code, owed)
| A | A |   | }
| A |   |   | function affiliatePayout(affs) {
| A |   |   |   for (var a = 0; a < affs.length; a++)
| A | A |   |     figurePayout(affs[a]);
| A |   |   | }
|   |   |   | function main(affs) {
| A |   |   |   affiliatePayout(affs);
|   |   |   | }
```

Of course, the inevitable actionhood of `main()` also follows from the same logic. *The entire program is an action* because of one tiny call to an action deep in the code.

What this example demonstrates is one of the properties of actions that make them so darn difficult to work with. *Actions spread*. If you call an action in a function, that function becomes an action. If you call that function in another function, it becomes an action. One little action somewhere and it spreads all over.
